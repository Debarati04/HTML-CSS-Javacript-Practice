         Hi everyone
        
        <p title="introduction"> 
            HTML was created by <i>Berners-Lee</i> in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard 
            HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. 
            Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, 
            and this version was published in 2012. <br />Hope you enjoy the course. <hr />

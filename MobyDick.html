                        I see him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief, 
                        mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. 
                        He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.<br />

                        It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have 
                        gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways 
                        find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale 
                        statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors 
                        generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, 
                        as affording a glancing birdâ€™s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, 
                        by many nations and generations, including our own.

            The Phantom Tollbooth is a 1961 children's adventure novel by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer (pictured). 
            It tells the story of a bored young boy named Milo, who unexpectedly receives a magic 
            tollbooth one afternoon and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car. 
            The tollbooth transports him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous, now troubled.
            There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses, 
            named Rhyme and Reason. The text is full of puns and wordplay; many events, such as when Milo unintentionally 
            jumps to Conclusions (an island in Wisdom), explore the literal meanings of idioms. 
            A major theme of the book is a love for education.
